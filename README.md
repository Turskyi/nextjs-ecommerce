# Anna's Artistic Store (Web)

Welcome to **Anna's Artistic Store**, a shop where creativity comes to life! ðŸŽ¨

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Available Versions

- **Next.js Version (Web)**:
  [https://anartist.turskyi.com](https://anartist.turskyi.com)  
   This version is built with Next.js and serves as the primary web application.
  It provides server-side rendering and SEO optimization, along with a RESTful
  API backend.

- **Flutter Version (Web)**:
  [https://anna-ecommerce.web.app](https://anna-ecommerce.web.app)  
   This version is built with Flutter for the web. It was created because
  Firebase hosting is free and easy to set up, requiring no additional
  maintenance. However, it is not used as the primary version due to Flutter
  web's limitations in server-side rendering and SEO optimization.

### Why Both Versions?

Having both versions allows us to leverage the strengths of each platform. The
Next.js version is optimized for SEO and serves as the backend API provider,
while the Flutter version showcases the flexibility of Flutter for web.
Since Firebase hosting is free and effortless to maintain, it made sense to have
it as an additional option.
